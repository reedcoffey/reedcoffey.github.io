            Reed Coffey is a visual artist based in Tucson, Arizona. Born in Washington state in 1995, they began painting at age twelve when the flexibility of online school allowed them to take an oil painting class at a local senior center. Their passion for art was reignited in 2021 through art courses at Pima Community College, beginning their most prolific creative period to date.

            Rooted in their childhood in the Pacific Northwest and shaped by a career in conservation, Reed’s oil paintings highlight the hidden details of the natural world. Their work captures the the quiet joy of discovery- rounding the corner of a trail to a breathtaking view, lifting a leaf to reveal a cluster of berries, or the visual rhythms present for those who take the time to observe them.

            Reed’s work has been featured in group exhibitions at Groundworks, Subspace, and Artistic InQUEERies in Tucson. They received an Honorable Mention in Painting at Pima Community College’s Spring 2021 Juried Student Exhibition and were featured on the cover of the 2022 edition of SandScript.

            The Agaves collection began as a stylistic exploration and became a celebration of the rhythmic,
            soothing pattern of agaves. I feel peaceful staring down at them, and find the sequence of leaf sizes as they grow
            and spread out deeply satisfying.

            The Pathways series is an examination of the marks people leave on the land as they move 
            through it. Inspired largely by the trailwork that represents a pivotal point in my career, 
            walkways weave through colorful landscapes over the course of several paintings.
            <br>
            <br>
            Pathways inspires curiosity about what's around the next bend of the trail; what sights and 
            secrets the landscape ahead holds. There's a balance to be had between urging yourself forward
            through difficult terrain and slowing down to appreciate the space you're in at a given moment.

            Morphology is a tribute to the range of ways similar structures can express themselves. I'm delighted every time
            I spot a berry or other fruit out on the trail, and I hope to convey that sense of discovery and wonder through this
            collection.
